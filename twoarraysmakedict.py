# Zip Arrays into Map

# Given two arrays, create an associative array (aka hash map, an obj / dictionary) 
# containing keys from the first array, and values from the second.
# Associative arrays are sometimes called maps because a key (string) maps to a value 

# Input: ["abc", 3, "yo"], [42, "wassup", True]
# Output: {
#     "abc": 42,
#     3: "wassup",
#     "yo": True,
# }
